- Used to run the main dashboard application.
### GPS Receiver

- Used to determine the go-kart's current speed and location.
### Ultrasonic sensor (x6)

- Used to calculate and determine the proximity of objects surrounding the go-kart
- Three ultrasonic sensors are positioned at the front of the go-kart, and three at the back
    
### Temperature and Humidity Sensor (x1)

- Used to determine the external temperature of the go-kart.
  
### Breadboard (x3)

- Used a half-sized 400 point breadboard to host the temperature sensor
- Used two full-sized 830 point breadboards to host 3 ultrasonic sensors each 

### Resistors
- Used a voltage divider circuit with 1kŒ© (x6) and 2kŒ© (x6) resistors to lower the sensor output voltage from 5V to 3.3V. Consider the example diagram below (values vary).

### Jumper wires

- Female-to-male jumper wires were used to connect the Raspberry Pi to the breadboards
- Female-to-female jumper wires were used to connect the buzzer to the Raspberry Pi
- Red = VCC
- Blue = Trig
- Yellow = Echo
- Black = Ground 
  
### Wide Angle Camera for Raspberry Pi (Inno-Maker)

- Used to play the startup sound for the dashboard and to play media.

### 7" IPS Touch Display

- Used to display the main dashboard application.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Software 
### Raspberry Pi:
- Raspbian (insert version here)
### Python
- Python 3.8.2

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems we ran into
- Many of the resources online were circuits with 1-2 ultrasonic sensors. Employing 6 ultrasonic sensors were a new obstacle that had to be overcome.
- Layering images over a video in the camera tab (ex. shapes and parking lines) were difficult as they would replace the video QLabel. The solution to this was to implement a vbox layout that hosts the necessary labels similar to an array.
